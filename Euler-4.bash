# A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
# The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


# expects largest number of x number of digits as argument. eg: 999 for 3 digits
# this is slow, I wouldn't do it with 4 digits...
